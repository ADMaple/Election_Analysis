 ## Election Audit Summary
 The data provided from this election can be used in many ways. In addition to the breakdowns already provided, the data can be analyzed in many other ways. 
 With some modifications to the code we can also determine how many votes each candidate received from each county.  The code can also be used by cloming on any data set from any state elections.
